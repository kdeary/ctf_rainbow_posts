# Rainbow Posts CTF Challenge

After seeing the success of their flagship product [Rainbow Notes](https://github.com/osirislab/CSAW-CTF-2023-Quals/tree/main/web/rainbow-notes), the Color Groupâ„¢ has created a new website, Rainbow Posts. Rainbow Posts comes with a new addition: Rainbow GLOWING Posts. Unfortunately, this feature is locked behind a paywall, Rainbow Posts Premium. Even worse, non-premium users can only submit ONE post now! Terrible!

You know that a certain Rainbow Posts Premium user accesses the site very frequently (every 15 seconds!!!). See if you can find a way to use their premium subscription.
